# Host      poller-hostname_or_centreon-configured-name
# HostName  poller-real_hostname_or_address
# User      poller-monitoring-user
#
# Example: 
#   o Our poller is configured with the name "poller007" in Centreon
#   o Our poller is at real address 172.42.13.37
#   o Our poller is running under the user centreon-engine
#
# Host      poller007
# HostName  172.42.13.37
# User      centreon-engine
#
# This configuration is only required when the poller user is not
# the same user that will connect to the poller.
# It will always be the case with these packages:
#   o Centreon connects with user "centreon"
#   o MonitoringEngine runs with user "centreon-engine"
